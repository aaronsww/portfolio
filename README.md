# Portfolio Website

The portfolio website is deployed and can be accessed at <a href="https://jeevanaaron.netlify.app/">https://jeevanaaron.netlify.app</a>

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website is built using Gatsby, a static site generator, and Graph QL, a query language for APIs. It showcases my projects, skills, and provides information about me.
